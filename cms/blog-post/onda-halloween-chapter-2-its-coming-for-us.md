But I didn’t open it. I put the red box on my desk and stared at it for a second. In the meantime another team member walked past behind me heading to the door. “See you tomorrow, guys!”. I replied back, although I was too lost, looking at this box. The sharp sound of a stuck door handle brought me back.

‍

“Hum… guys? The door is not opening.”

‍

I left the box on my desk and went to the door. Indeed, we were locked, but how could we be? Who locked us in?

‍

“Does someone have the key?”

‍

We looked for our keys where we expected to find them, but all we found were beans of coffee.

‍

“Who put coffee beans in my purse?”, one of the girls asked.

‍

“I don’t know, but I have them in my pocket as well.”

‍

A heavy, icy cold ripped through the air of the studio, and, all of a sudden, the lights were out.

‍

We started listening to steps, approaching, closer and closer.

‍
