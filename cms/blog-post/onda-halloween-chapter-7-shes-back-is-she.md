‍

“You could have saved her!”

‍

“Who’s this?!”

‍

Moved by a mixture of anger and anxiety, one of the girls takes the phone from my hand and said in a commanding tone:

‍

“Listen, we are not kidding around! Tell us who you are!”

‍

“Darling?”

‍

“Darling who? Open this door immediately! I swear we’re going to find you!”

‍

And then, just like that, her daring courage abandons her, as she changes to a soft speech and tone.

‍

“Please open the damn door. What do you want from us?”

‍

There was a short break from the other side of the line.

‍

“My darling, I’m so sorry I couldn’t save you.”

‍

“Who are you talking to?”

‍

“I’m talking to you. You remember me, right?”

‍

We were all staring at her, not knowing what she was listening to, not knowing what was inside her head. And, maybe because of our stares, she decided to play along.

‍

“How couldn’t I?”

‍

“My love. It’s so good to hear from you again. I’ve missed you so much! I’m so sorry.”

‍

She took a deep breath.

‍

“Listen, I know you’ve missed me, but could you please take these people out of the office? Please?”

‍

“Is the boss there?”

‍

She looked at me.

‍

“No. These are innocent people.”

‍

“Just because you asked, my love, I’ll do it. I would do anything for you — if I could.”

‍

“I know you would.”

‍

And the call hung up again.

‍

“What happened?”

‍

Before she could answer, we heard our main door opening.

‍

_To be continued…_
