‍

We opened the box and we found a key and a handwritten note.

‍

_“Good morning, my love. I couldn’t sleep so I’m taking a walk in the woods. I made you coffee._

‍

_I promise you better days will come. Have a good day at the mill!”_

‍

The note had brown stains.

‍

“Dude, what were you doing in the kitchen?”

‍

“Coffee”

‍

“Don’t drink that shit!”

‍

The child’s weeps got stronger, and, from the voice, it seemed to be a boy.

‍

One of the girls got closer to the cupboard and tried to open it.

‍

“It’s also locked.”

‍

I looked at the key. I was sure it wasn’t our main door key. I looked around. We were all thinking the same thing.

‍

I walked towards the sobs. I put the key inside the lock and turned it. We heard a click. The crying stopped — and I opened the door.

‍

_To be continued…_
