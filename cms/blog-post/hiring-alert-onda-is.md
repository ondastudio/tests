### **We were bored too, purely bored.**

‍

We didn’t want to build just another website, nor we wanted a branding project to be just one more. No. Life’s too short for that. What we really wanted was to feel proud, exciting, and remove all the dullness off the internet. Wouldn’t you love that?

‍

**That is why we created Onda.**

‍

Onda Studio is a design studio made to smash the boredom in the digital world. We make a difference in defining brands and their experience. We want our clients to see our work and say “Wow!”

‍

‍

### **Who are we looking for?**

‍

✔️ You’re a creative developer.

✔️ You’ve got the skills to work on the visual side of the web.

✔️ You’ve got the technical skills to work on web and brand identity.

✔️ You ain’t got no problem dealing with clients.

‍

‍

### **What do you gain with Onda?**

‍

You want more than a salary, right? Here’s what we got!

‍

💻 Remote-first environment. Work from home if you want. Remote candidates are welcome!

🔋 Autonomy. Work when you want too. We trust you.

‍

🌴 Unlimited vacations. You choose when you go off and on.

‍

🏃‍♀ Health insurance. Ain’t no marriage, but we are with you in sickness and health.

‍

🙋‍♂ 🙋 Pretty nice colleagues. Seriously, we are.

‍

🤺 Discount at a gym in Braga.

⌨️ Cool laptop, mouse, screen, and keyboard.

‍

💰 Budget for equipment, events, and technical books.
