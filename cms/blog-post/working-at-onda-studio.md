### Let's talk about culture

‍

So you want to know what's like to work here?

‍

There are no secrets at Onda. It’s no secret why and how we started either. We wanted a change. We wanted to work at a design studio where we'd bring digital solutions to worthy problems. Furthermore, we didn't want to have that feeling of "argh, not again. Just another one. Another ordinary, boring project."

‍

You can read more about our beginning in our first blog post.

‍

**And so we created Onda.**

‍

### What do we want?

‍

We want to do what we love, and we base ourselves on these values:

‍

*   creativity
*   collaboration
*   humility
*   ambition
*   learning
*   the team comes first, always
*   build valuable work and feel proud of it

‍

It’s important for us that everyone feels comfortable to contribute with their unique fingerprint and explore new lands. To be part of our team means to bring it on! Bring the best work we can deliver and be ready to learn.

‍

‍

### How is it to be part of the Onda team?

‍

Let us introduce ourselves. We have Francisco, who founded Onda with Roberto. Two Inês (one wasn't enough), one is a copywriter and the other is a designer. Joining the designers squad, we have Rafael, Bárbara and Tom. Last but not least, we have Miguel, who not only designs, but also develops everything the user interacts with.

‍

We are nice people. We like to work together and have our chilled moments too, where we just talk about anything but work\*.

‍

We have zero judgment and curious minds.

‍

‍

### What are the perks in this design studio?

‍
