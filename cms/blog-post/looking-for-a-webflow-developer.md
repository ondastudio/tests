### We were bored too, purely bored.

‍

We didn’t want to build just another website again, nor we wanted a branding project to be just another one.

‍

No. Life’s too short for that.

‍

What we really wanted was to feel proud, excited, and remove all the dullness off the internet.

‍

‍

### Wouldn’t you love that too?

‍

**That is why we created Onda.**

‍

We're a design studio made to break the boredom in the digital world. We make a difference in defining brands and their experiences. We want people to see our work and say “Wow!”

‍

‍

### Who are we looking for?

‍

We’re looking for people who are passionate about design, copywriting, web3, and technology in general to join us.

‍

We don’t care so much about your years of experience — it’s what you can bring to the table that counts, skills and personality-wise.

‍

✔️ You’re a creative developer.

✔️ You’ve experience with Webflow.

✔️ You’re into no-code tools and always looking for new ones.

✔️ You love to spread the word (sharing your new findings with the team).

✔️ You ain’t got no problem dealing with clients.

✔️ You're based in Europe.

‍

‍

### What are the perks in this design studio?

‍

Let's cut to the chase.

‍

💱 Salary (of course).

💻 We're remote-first. Remote candidates are welcome. We also have an office (in Braga, Portugal) if you want to go there.

🔋 We're all responsible and trust each other. Therefore, we give you the freedom to make your own schedule and work where you want.

🌴 30-day limit vacations. You choose when you go off and on.

🏃‍♀ Health insurance, because we want you to be at your best.

⌨️ Cool laptop, mouse, screen, and keyboard.

👩🏽‍⚕️ Anual healthcare services budget.

📚 Anual learning experience budget.

☕ Anual work better budget.

🎩 No more suits and ties. Wear what you want.

🕔 Time to hang out and relax.

‍

‍
