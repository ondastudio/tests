It was a moisty cold Thursday and, of all the people in the world, this was someone we didn’t expect to meet. The clock struck 6 pm when he knocked on our door. He was an old gentleman, wearing pale white gloves, a top hat, and a frock coat as dark as the night. He seemed like the doorman of the fancy hotel, which we are not. The wrinkles around his eyes told tales of a long-suffering past.

‍

“Good evening, sir. Is the boss in the office?”

‍

Didn’t know what to reply as we don’t have hierarchies, but just for the sake of it:

‍

“Yes.”

‍

“Very well. I have something for the boss.”

‍

He handed me a box. I felt odd. I wasn’t expecting any deliveries, but even if I were, I doubt they would come in such a smooth blood red box. And just as I was about to ask who it was from, he vanished. I didn’t even have time to say “thank you”. I turned back to the office and closed the door behind me.

‍

“Who was it?” asked one of my teammates.

‍

“I don’t know. He looked like a doorman. He gave me this”

‍

“What is it?”

‍

“I don’t know. I’ll open it.”

‍

_To be continued…_
