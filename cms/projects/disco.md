  The fact that the brand was in its early stages and had very few applications
  defined was definitely a challenge. We had to explore and create new visuals
  for the brand for the website to really work.

  ### “Their strength lies in their designs, which are very modern and
  up-to-date with current trends. I was also impressed with their Webflow
  expertise; they could use the tool to its maximum capacity.”

  From the beginning of our work, it was clear that we wanted to visually
  highlight the connection with projects inside Web3, especially the ones
  related to the metaverse.


  ‍


  We aimed for a bright and bold approach, exploring different scales and
  expressions through typography.


  ‍


  The gradients were also elements present in the brand, so we worked to
  brighten them up and create an animated and engaging experience, mainly as
  backgrounds from several sections.
