  DeNites faced some challenges because it is a new concept, not yet well known,
  and it is in direct competition with official afterparties of crypto events.
  We needed to make DeNites stand out from the crowd and become the coolest and
  most inviting afterparty.

  DeNites are decentralised afterparties. And we’ll always deny they exist.
  DeNites are gatherings that showcase local web3 projects and startups in the
  most entertaining way. They take place during the big crypto conferences in
  Lisbon.

  We created an identity that tells the story of a place where people gather to
  have a good time and enjoy the party together. The colours are loud and bright
  because of the vibrant environment of DeNites. The use of deconstructed
  imagery relates to the digital and tech industry.

DeNites are decentralised afterparties. And we’ll always deny they exist.  
  
DeNites are gatherings that showcase local web3 projects and startups in the most entertaining way. They take place during the big crypto conferences in Lisbon.  
  
We helped launch this series of events and did their branding and landing page. We wanted to communicate the feeling of meeting new people and networking while having fun, and how it is to party like a local.
