  Your job doesn’t have to mean stress, anxiety or working late hours. You can
  conquer anything by talking. We just need to start the conversation. That’s
  why we worked together with MindPartner, the team of psychologists that help
  HR and management teams foster a better place to work, by taking care of the
  employer's mental health.

f_challenge: "We faced two main challenges with this project. \LOn one hand, MindPartner was a new company and wasn’t yet established on the market, so we needed to build a strong identity in a way that could position them as experts that companies can trust. On the other hand, mental health itself is still a big taboo, and many companies in Portugal still don't acknowledge the impact it can have on a worker's happiness, productivity and talent."

  The logo uses two dots that convey two different meanings: a partner always
  there for you, and ellipsis to indicate a conversation happening. The
  typography used is a friendly serif that communicates an approachable feeling.
f_custom-text-2: >-
  The language is friendly and down-to-earth, which make the user easily relate.
  We wanted to spread the message that mental health is essential and needs to
  be nourished, so we can be good with ourselves. The voice of the brand is
  calm, present, and inviting to a conversation while showing empathy. The key
  message is that MindPartner minds your team's mental health, and that trusted
  as a business partner.

  The visual identity communicates a human and approachable feeling. The use of
  gradients and animation convey a smooth experience with a lot of different
  possible visual combinations, as if the brand is a living being, breathing and
  talking with you. It positions MindPartner as mindful and personal.

Your job doesn’t have to mean stress, anxiety or working late hours. You can conquer anything by talking. We just need to start the conversation. That’s why we worked together with MindPartner, the team of psychologists that help HR and management teams foster a better place to work, by taking care of the employer's mental health.

We worked to give them a new and strong brand identity and website. Our goal was to create a mindful and friendly experience that could reinforce MindPartner's value to any business of any size.
