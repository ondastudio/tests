  important to give a new life to used cooking oil.

f_custom-text-1: >-
  The logo is a liquid "U" that reminds us of used cooking oil. We paired it
  with a neat and fluid sans-serif typeface that emphasises the reliable side of
  the brand.
f_custom-text-2: >-
  For the colour palette, we made a connection with oil while making it fresh,
  light, and unexpected. Neon yellow is the perfect pop colour to contrast with
  neutral blue backgrounds. Together they create a reliable touch with a fresh
  vibrancy.


  ‍


  As for copywriting, we took an educational approach to their process while
  appealing to what people will really get when they invest in UCO Network: the
  most sustainable tokens and a contribution to the greater good, with a company
  that is growing.
f_custom-text-3: >-
  We created the typemark from the UCO name, inspired by the logo, to use as
  graphic elements.


  ‍


  We know the importance of building a brand identity that can vary its
  expression in its application and that is flexible so it can grow over time.
f_solution: >-
  When opening their website, people will see straightaway what is in UCO
  Network for them. Through copywriting, supported by appealing visuals, users
  see what’s the issue and get solutions that serve them. All this with
  lucrative and sustainable tokens.

UCO Network is the public blockchain protocol where used cooking oil gains a new life, as a profitable and environmental-friendly resource. This is done throughout the supply chain.

The team trusted us with their branding and website. As any new business, UCO Network wanted to make a good first impression, especially in the Web3 space, where so many projects are launching.

‍

The result is a fresh website for the most sustainable tokens in Web3, and an identity that is trustworthy and clean.
