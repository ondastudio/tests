  The main challenge we faced was the fact that Aura is a very complex and
  not-physical product, which is difficult to explain, even for people with a
  deep understanding of DeFi. Representing this complexity in an impactful, easy
  to understand and innovative way became our ultimate goal.
f_solution: >-
  We decided to explore the concept of transformation and metamorphosis
  throughout the whole experience, to represent the growth and energy transfer
  among people, which is what happens with Aura.

  The distinctive symbol explores the relationship between empty and full, white
  space and filled space. The width of the lines creates an optical illusion,
  giving the feeling of something approaching us and filling the space. The left
  to right movement conveys the idea of something growing, becoming bigger and
  stronger.

  Since we were dealing with very complex content, we leaned on motion graphics,
  creative coding, micro animations and interactions to provide a truly
  engaging, friendly and interesting scroll experience for any user. Charts can
  be scary and heavy and we made sure we were building them in a way that was
  easy to read, using just the indispensable information and then animating
  them.
f_custom-text-3: >-
  We also created some p5.js experiences that were used along the homepage
  scroll to make it more dynamic and alive. These pieces of code made the hero
  look really catchy at first sight and also worked as a break between sections
  with complex information and informative texts, as well as serving as a visual
  representation of the growth Aura provides.  
    
  The use of Webflow to implement this website allowed us to build its static
  version very quickly in order to have more time to really focus on all these
  animations in detail and make the final output a case study we're proud of.

  ### “Onda's process is very polished. The discovery process is well structured
  and so is the delivery. The delivery part is quite iterative and they will
  work with you until you have something that truly represents your brand and
  product.”
