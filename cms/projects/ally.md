f_challenge: >-
  We actually had three challenges in one (not in this specific order): to
  create a curated experience, develop the brand’s personality, and make people
  feel personally taken care of. At the end of the day, we wanted people to be
  happy for receiving a box made personally for them, and to always look forward
  to receiving the next one.
title: Ally
f_solution: >-
  A down to earth, inclusive, and good spirited brand. To achieve this we worked
  on design assets and a tone of voice that engage the user, making the
  experience of receiving the Ally box feel personally made for them, beyond
  just the specific snacks inside.

f_custom-text-1: >-
  As it’s a personal service, we wanted to give a personal name to the brand.
  Ally ties in with the charming personality we wanted to create and the
  personal experience. Besides, let’s not forget that it’s all about taking
  snacks person**ally** too.
f_custom-text-2: >-
  Ally is all about catering to personal preferences while opening up a world of
  snacking possibilities.  
    
  It was important the packaging reflected its healthy focus and caring
  attitude. We wanted the customer to feel this was a personal experience by
  using hand written elements and using stickers to make each box personal,
  every time.
f_custom-text-3: >-
  Ally, the mascot, is adventurous, curious, and irreverent. Ally's eyes are
  always visible to portray its constant search for the best snacks.  
    
  We tell stories that show how much Ally cares. Ally is bothered when we don't
  have food, and it is willing to fight crocodiles, climb trees, swim to the
  deepest sea, or make monkeys go bananas - all this to find the best snacks.  
    
  This mascot has an endless hunger for variety and bringing joy to people.
