f_challenge: >-
  Taikai recently merged with Bepro and wanted a rebranding and a new website to
  match that big change.
title: Taikai
f_custom-text-1: >-
  The logo finds its form in the typographic construction logic associated with
  the stencil. Each element depends and cooperates for the understanding of the
  whole. The logo is based on LaForge Stencil typography and all characters were
  redrawn to increase the line thickness and decrease the spacing between
  elements.
f_custom-text-2: >-
  The elements that build the logotype can be used as ornamental items when
  communicating on digital and physical spaces. These elements have the power to
  live by their own but also flexibility to be grouped with others — individual
  and collective strength, both important when competing.
f_custom-text-3: Made in collaboration with André Pimentel Santos.
f_solution: >-
  We created a brand identity that visually represents a space of growth,
  collaboration, and competition.

  Taikai is a builder hub that connects creators and companies, using
  hackathons, bounties and hiring challenges to help talent grow.
