  Finiam is a small and curious team focused on the development of fintech
  products. We did a branding revamp, design and development for their new
  website, and a marketing strategy for its relaunch.

f_challenge: >-
  We wanted to expand the brand identity and create a visual communication. As
  Finiam is focused on development, they were lacking visual representations of
  what they really do.


  ‍


  Besides, Finiam wanted to take this opportunity to start using social media
  more strategically and also to attract talented people.

  As they say: “Crypto madness? We make it easy.” For that, it was essential to
  reinforce the voice and the brand's communication, so it looks and feels
  unique and memorable.
f_custom-text-2: >-
  We needed to expand the identity to create new possibilities for using the
  brand in different mediums. One of the ways to do this was to rethink the
  colour system.


  ‍


  Earth-colours helped to give this brand a more human feeling. This was also a
  great strategy to avoid the usual blue and dark colours, which are often used
  in the tech industry.
f_custom-text-3: >-
  We made the human feeling present on the copy combined with the use of
  illustration created by Rita Laranja.


  ‍


  For the logo, each letter grows its personality. We gave them movement,
  dynamics, and scale so that they can work individually. We also worked with
  p5.js to create cool interactive animations for the headers, so each user can
  have a surprising experience while exploring the website.

f_solution: >-
  We positioned Finiam as they are: human, approachable, and skilful; with a
  people-first mindset. We expanded their visual identity by reworking their
  colour palette and adding movement, motion, and illustration to the brand.


  ‍


  We also prepared a social media plan with content focused on their goals. This
  plan is consistent and targeted to the channels that make sense.

  ### “The communication between our team and Onda was clear, easy, and
  consistent. Onda was very welcoming of feedback and open to discussing new
  solutions. Besides, they did offer new inputs we could have never thought of,
  which delivered a lot of value to our brand.”
