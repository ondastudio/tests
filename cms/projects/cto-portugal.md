  To create a website that communicates who this community is for, how to join,
  and the requirements to become a member.
title: CTO Portugal
f_solution: >-
  A lively landing page that introduces the community and promotes its members
  and their journey in technology. All this with the empathic message that

  Orange and yellow are the colours of CTO Portugal. We chose orange for the
  background because its strength makes the landing page remarkable.  
    
  The tech industry is full of life, dynamic, and is made of new perspectives
  and solutions. Inspired by that, we created a layout that is clean and easy to
  navigate, and we added animations to bring more energy to it.  
    
  The animation in the header, for example, shows the variety of topics around
  leadership that members can talk about in this community. The "house rules"
  animations help to grab the reader's attention to more static content.

  Regarding the tone of voice and the brand's personality, we went to the heart
  of why tech leaders would like to join. After studying the target audience, we
  realised that people in leadership roles can feel isolated sometimes. This is
  because their job requires making decisions and guiding people without having
  someone to ask for advice.

  CTO Portugal is an inclusive and safe space where tech leaders can exchange
  knowledge and experiences without being judged, creating a feeling of
  camaraderie and sharing insights that will make one a better person and a
  better leader. Thus, we developed a voice that is welcoming, inclusive and
  modest. The copy shows the spirit of comradeship and respect lived in the
  community.  
    
  This project was designed in collaboration with Jagoda Kondratiuk.
