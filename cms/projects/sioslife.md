  Sioslife improves the quality of life of elders and day centres staff with
  technology. Their software products aim to increase the well-being and promote
  the inclusion of the seniors in society, bringing them closer to their
  interests and their loved ones. We worked on a brand refresh from strategy to
  rebranding and everything in-between.
f_challenge: >-
  To create a brand that shows the human side of Sioslife, as well as the value
  that their tech products offer to elders, their loved ones and day centre
  staff. We wanted people to see Sioslife's ambition in making people's lives
  better, as well as how dynamic and versatile they are.

  The core of the branding is people, inclusivity and positivism, because that’s
  what Sioslife is all about.  
    
  We explored the accessible and interactive component that Sioslife brings to
  their users. Therefore, the drawing of the stick was made by using images of
  the end-users using Sioslife’s products and services. This is a way to express
  the brand’s dynamic and joyful side.

  "Movement" was the name of the game for this project. It means flow, activity
  and innovation. When we think of movement, we think of people dancing,
  walking, enjoying their life. Following this line of thought, we built a brand
  that felt approachable, happy and innovative. We wanted its personality to be
  caring and good spirited.
