  Stability gives people a sense of safety. It makes us feel like we know what
  to expect.

    

  In a world where we crave spontaneity, itâ€™s still good to know that there are
  things we can rely on - like Go Stable. On their website, we wanted users to
  feel that this is a product they can use with confidence.

  Go Stable allows users to quickly swap between their digital assets in a
  private, seamless and secure way.
f_challenge: >-
  We wanted their branding and website to mirror stabilisation, which is the
  goal of this product. Their logo and name are a statement that communicates
  the best way to go - forward.
